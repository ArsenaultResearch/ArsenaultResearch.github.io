Hi, my name is Sam Arsenault and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Buck Trible's lab at Harvard University. I received my Ph.D. in Entomology in 2020 from the University of Georgia under the direction of Brendan Hunt. My work explored the links between DNA methylation, transcription, adn social behavior in subsocial bees and the molecular mechanisms through which the fire ant social chromosome induces polygyny. After completing my Ph.D., I began working with Buck studying the genetic basis for queen morphological polymorphisms in Leptothorax ants and the molecular and developmental mechanisms regulating morphological castes in ants. 

Outside of my research, I enjoy cycling around Cambridge, playing Dungeons and Dragons, and hanging out with my two fuzzy roommates (Barry and Penelope). I've also recently started learning how to bookbind!
