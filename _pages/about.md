I am an entomologist and bioinformatician interested in polymorphisms both as they affect evolution and ecology and as tools for understanding the molecular basis of complex phenotypes. My research  leverages a combination of comparative genomics, *in vivo* functional experiments, and traditional ecological surveys to explore questions of social and morphological evolution in non-model insects. I have developed the queen polymorphic ant *Leptothorax ergatogyneous* as a new model system to study the evolutionary and ecological impacts of polymoprhisms. In my work, I use genotypic and phenotypic variation as a natural laboratory for the study of fundamental problems in evolution, development, and ecology.
