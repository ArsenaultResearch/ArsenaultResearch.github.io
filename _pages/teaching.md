# Philosophy
Learning frequently occurs outside the traditional boundaries of the classroom, flourishing in the conversations among students, the discussions during office hours, and the hands-on experiences found in the field and the lab. I believe that students internalize knowledge more efficiently in these diverse learning environments through collaboration and exploration. My teaching philosophy emphasizes these mixed venues to foster deeper engagement and understanding. Drawing from my varied teaching experiences, I am committed to offering a broad range of learning environments that help students connect abstract concepts to real-world phenomena.

# Experience
## LS50 - Integrated Science, Harvard University 2022
In collaboration with Buck Trible, we developed a novel section of a research-focussed course for Harvard University first-year undergadautes. We instructed students on the preparation, care, and handling of insect specimens from the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. We then mentored them through the process of developing and implementing a comparative morphological experiment using a phylogenetic independent contrasts approach. As an instructor of this course, I gave multiple lectures throughout the semester and taught students museum imaging techniques, data analysis, and figure generation. At the end of the semester, students presented their findings on the morphology of invasive ants, color pattern mimicry, and polyandry at a departmental symposium.

## BIOL 1108L - Principles of Biology II Lab, University of Georgia 2017,2018
BIOL 1108L is the laboratory component for the second semester of introductory biology for science majors. I was the instructor of record for this course for two semester. I developed lectures and course materials, delivered lectures to my classes of 25-30 students, and led them on field work expeditions as part of their research projects. I was awarded the Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award in recognition of my work in BIOL 1108L.
